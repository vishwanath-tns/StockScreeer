SIMPLE VCP PATTERN EXPLANATION
=============================

Think of VCP like a coiled spring:

1. UPTREND PHASE (Green area):
   - Stock moves up strongly
   - Attracts attention from investors
   - Volume is high

2. BASE FORMATION PHASE (Blue area):
   - Stock takes a "rest" from the uptrend  
   - Creates 3-4 pullbacks (contractions)
   - Each pullback gets SMALLER (like a coiled spring)
   - Volume DECREASES during pullbacks (weak hands selling)
   - This is the VCP pattern forming

3. BREAKOUT PHASE (Yellow area):
   - Stock breaks above the highest point of the base
   - Volume INCREASES (strong hands buying)
   - Like a coiled spring being released
   - This is where profits can be made

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER:
- Each contraction should be smaller than the last one
- Volume should dry up during contractions  
- The pattern can take 2-6 months to form
- Quality patterns have 3+ contractions
- Best patterns occur after a significant uptrend

TRADING RULES:
- Only buy AFTER breakout above resistance
- Use increased volume to confirm breakout
- Set stop loss below the last contraction low
- Target 20-30% gains from breakout point
