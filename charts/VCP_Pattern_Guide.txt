VCP PATTERN EXPLANATION GUIDE
============================

What is a VCP (Volatility Contracting Pattern)?
-----------------------------------------------
A VCP is a chart pattern where:
1. Stock builds a "base" over several weeks/months
2. During this base, volatility contracts (price swings get smaller)  
3. Each pullback is smaller than the previous one
4. Volume dries up during pullbacks
5. Eventually, stock breaks out to new highs

How to Read the VCP Charts:
--------------------------

GREEN SHADED AREA = VCP Base Period
   This is where the pattern is forming

BLUE SHADED AREAS = Contractions (C1, C2, C3...)
   Each contraction should be smaller than the previous

VOLUME BARS = Trading Activity
   Volume should decrease during contractions
   Green bars = up days, Red bars = down days

RED DASHED LINE = Breakout Level
   This is where you might consider buying
   Wait for stock to break above this level with volume

MOVING AVERAGES = Trend Context
   Orange line = 20-day average (short-term trend)
   Red line = 50-day average (medium-term trend)

What Makes a Good VCP Pattern?
-----------------------------
- 3+ contractions with decreasing volatility
- Each pullback shallower than the last
- Volume dries up during pullbacks  
- Stock holds above key moving averages
- Quality score above 70

Trading the VCP:
----------------
1. Wait for breakout above resistance (red line)
2. Look for increased volume on breakout
3. Set stop loss below the last contraction low
4. Target: 20-30% gain from breakout point
